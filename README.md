# Anomaly-Detection-WebApp

### Summary
This Project is a web application that is used for detecting anomalies in filghts.<br />
In the app, the user needs to upload two csv files: one of a normal flight for the learning step and other of a regular flight for the detecting step.<br />
After the user uploads the files, he will be able to see all the anomalies that occured during the flight.<br />
This MVC project is coded in node.js and also uses the C++ files from the Anomaly-Detection project.
